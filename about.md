## WELCOME TO MY PAGE

My name is Chigbundu Ndubuisi Victor Okereke, I live in Port harcourt Nigeria. 
I'm a graduate of Civil Engineering from Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic in Rivers state, Nigeria.
I've worked in a number of construction firms in Port harcourt as a site supervisor and consulting engineer, these firms are Lenony Projects, Onche Associates, RC Portland and Line Consult where I am currently the lead project supervisor.
During this time, I have been involved in the design and construction of numerous building projects all over Nigeria which I am extremely proud of.
However, over the past two years, I've developed an immense love for tech, particularly cloud computing. And with how saturated and poorly regulated the Nigerian Civil Engineering ecosystem is currently, I've always known that a complete switch to tech is imminent for me. 
As a result of this, I set a goal for myself that come January 2024, I will embark on a trainning in Cloud solutions and work hard to become an expert in cloud services and gain all the certifications I need to become a practicing Cloud Architect.
I am excited about beginning my journey with Tech Expert Academy, and considering that I have previously learnt how to make use of some engineering and architectural softwares such as Archicad, Autocad, 3ds max, revit and also photoshop on my own, I have unwavering trust and confidence in my ability to successfully complete the trainning and hopefully go on to have an amazing and profitable work relatioship with Tech Expert Academy.
