## WELCOME TO MY PAGE

My name is Chigbundu Ndubuisi Victor Okereke, I live in Port harcourt Nigeria. I'm a graduate of Civil Engineering from Ken Sarowiwa Polytechnic in River's state, Nigeria.
I've worked in a number of construction firms in Port harcourt, such as Lenony Projects, Onche Associates, and Line Consult as a site supervisor and consulting engineer. 
During this time, I was involved in the design and construction of numerous building projects all over Nigeria.
But over the past two years, I've developed an immense love for tech, particularly cloud computing. And with how saturated and poorly regulated the Nigerian Civil Engineering ecosystem is currently, I've always kwown that a complete switch to tech is imminent for me. As a result of this, I set a goal for myself that come January 2024, I will embark on a trainning in Cloud solutions and work hard to become an expert in cloud services and gain all the certifications I need to become a Cloud Architect and start practicing.
I am excited about beginning my journey with Tech Expert Academy and I have unwavering trust and confidence in my ability to successfully complete the trainning and hopefully go om to have an amazing and profitable work relatioship with Tech Expert Academy.
