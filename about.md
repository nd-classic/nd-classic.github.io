## WELCOME TO MY PAGE

My name is Chigbundu Ndubuisi Victor Okereke. I live in Port Harcourt Nigeria. 
I'm a graduate of Civil Engineering from Kenule Beeson Saro-Wiwa Polytechnic in Rivers State, Nigeria.
I've worked in several construction firms in Port Harcourt as a site supervisor and consulting engineer. These firms are Lenony Projects, Onche Associates, RC Portland, and Line Consult, where I am currently the lead project supervisor.
During this time, I have been involved in the design and construction of numerous building projects all over Nigeria which I am extremely proud of.
However, over the past two years, I've developed an immense love for tech, particularly cloud computing. And with how saturated and poorly regulated the Nigerian Civil Engineering ecosystem is, I've always known that a complete switch to tech is imminent for me. 
As a result, I set a goal for myself that come January 2024, I will embark on a training in Cloud solutions and work hard to become an expert in cloud services and gain all the certifications I need to become a practicing Cloud Architect.
I am excited about beginning my journey with Tech Expert Academy, and considering that I have previously learned how to make use of some engineering and architectural software tools such as Archicad, Autocad, 3ds max, Revit, and Photoshop on my own, I have unwavering trust and confidence in my ability to complete the training and hopefully go on to have an amazing and profitable work relationship with Tech Expert Academy.
